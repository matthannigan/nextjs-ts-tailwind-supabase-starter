What is its role in test-driven development? How has its approach and tools changed over the years for React developers? How do I construct good React component tests? How can I make sure when debugging tests that I\u2019m not \u201cteaching to the test\u201d\u2014making edits to the test simply based on knowledge of the component code? How does unit testing fit into other good practices like linting and automated end-to-end testing. What are some good resources if I want to further develop my knowledge in this area?\\n```"},{"id":"/2025/03/25/discovered-docusaurus","metadata":{"permalink":"/nextjs-ts-tailwind-supabase-starter/blog/2025/03/25/discovered-docusaurus","editUrl":"https://github.com/matthannigan/nextjs-ts-tailwind-supabase-starter/tree/main/docs-website/blog/2025-03-25-discovered-docusaurus.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-25-discovered-docusaurus.md","title":"Discovered Docusaurus","description":"Was having too many problems deploying to Github Pages with plain Jekyll because","date":"2025-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Documentation","permalink":"/nextjs-ts-tailwind-supabase-starter/blog/tags/documentation"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Matt Hannigan","url":"https://matthannigan.com","page":null,"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/matthannigan","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthannigan/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/matthannigan.png","key":"matthannigan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Discovered Docusaurus","authors":["matthannigan"],"tags":["documentation"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Unit Testing","permalink":"/nextjs-ts-tailwind-supabase-starter/blog/2025/03/26/unit-testing"}},"content":"Was having too many problems deploying to Github Pages with plain Jekyll because \\nReact component code examples were trying to be processed by Liquid.\\n\\nSearched and found Docusaurus as a more contemporary alternative.\\n\\nConverted old `/docs` folder in repo to subfolder of new `docs-website`."}]}}')}}]);
