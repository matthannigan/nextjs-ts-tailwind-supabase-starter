# Documentation Creation Task for `Navbar Mobile`

## Background
I need to create comprehensive documentation for the `NavbarMobile` component that follows our project's standardized format. This component was integrated from shadcn/ui into our Next.js TypeScript TailwindCSS Supabase starter project.

## Component Research
1. First, examine our project's implementation:
   - Use the filesystem MCP server to look at our source code at `/Users/matth/Github/MGH/nextjs-ts-tailwind-supabase-starter/src/components/[path]/navbar-mobile.tsx`
   - Note any customizations we've made to the original shadcn component
   - Identify any project-specific usage patterns
   - Check existing imports in other components to see real usage examples

2. Then, use the fetch MCP server to the fetch the official Shadcn UI documentation from `https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/navbar-mobile` and then conduct a targeted web search to understand:
   - The component's purpose and core functionality
   - Available props and their default values
   - Variants and styling options
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Known limitations

## Documentation Creation
1. Use the filesystem MCP server to copy our template at `/Users/matth/Github/MGH/nextjs-ts-tailwind-supabase-starter/docs/components/component-documentation-template.md` as your base structure.

2. Complete each section of the template with specific information:
   - Write a clear, concise component description (1-2 sentences)
   - Include correct import statements using our project's path conventions
   - Show basic usage examples with minimal props
   - Demonstrate all major variants and prop combinations
   - Create a complete props table with accurate types, defaults, and descriptions
   - Include TypeScript type definitions that match our implementation
   - Show realistic customization examples using TailwindCSS classes
   - Provide integration examples with other components in our library
   - Document responsive behavior across device sizes
   - Detail any accessibility features or considerations

3. Add react-hook-form integration examples where applicable, as our project uses this library.

4. Include any shadcn/ui installation commands if the component requires additional dependencies.

## Special Considerations
- Focus on our project's specific implementation, not just generic shadcn/ui usage
- Include common pitfalls specific to our tech stack (Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS)
- Reference related components from our library when appropriate
- Add testing examples using our project's testing setup (React Testing Library)
- Use consistent code formatting matching our project style

## Deliverable
A comprehensive markdown document that follows our template structure and provides detailed, accurate guidance for developers in our specific project context.
