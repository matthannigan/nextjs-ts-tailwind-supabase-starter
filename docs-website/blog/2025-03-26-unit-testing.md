Asked Gemini Deep Resarch to create report

```
Help me understand React unit testing. What is its role in test-driven development? How has its approach and tools changed over the years for React developers? How do I construct good React component tests? How can I make sure when debugging tests that I’m not “teaching to the test”—making edits to the test simply based on knowledge of the component code? How does unit testing fit into other good practices like linting and automated end-to-end testing. What are some good resources if I want to further develop my knowledge in this area?
